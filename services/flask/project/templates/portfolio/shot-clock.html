                        <p><strong>Description:</strong> This project entails the creation of a poker shot
                        clock. The device is designed to manage the timing of player decisions during a poker game,
                        enhancing the pace of play and ensuring fair timing for all participants. The shot clock
                        features a clear display and intuitive controls, making it an easy-to-use tool for all degrees of poker games.

                        <p><strong>Development Stage:</strong> Currently in its advanced prototype phase, the poker shot
                        clock employs a combination of custom-designed electronics and user-friendly firmware. The
                        device is powered by a STM32 microcontroller that ensures accurate timekeeping and responsive
                        operation. The clockâ€™s housing is custom 3D printed PLA enclosure, made to be easily mass-produced.

                        <strong>Technical Highlights:</strong>
                        <p>
                            The STM32 microcontroller has a custom CLI (command line interface) over UART for easy debugging and upgrading.
                            Each set of two digit display has its own daughter carrier board. These boards feature an IIC LED controller.
                            The driver written for this chip, ensures that each LED stays individually addressable, with a PWM signal.
                            The choice for this daughter board setup stems from the requirement of keeping everything easily manufacture-able and quick to assemble.
                            The footprint of the segment display, perfectly fit on top of the daughter board, and the daughter board fits snugly inside the 3D printed enclosure.
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Precision Timing:</strong> The shot clock offers precise countdown and alarm
                                functionalities, with adjustable settings to accommodate different game formats and
                                player preferences.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Display and Controls:</strong> Featuring a bright LED display, the clock ensures
                                visibility from across the table. The user can control the clock with 3 function buttons.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Custom Housing:</strong> The 3D printed casing not only enhances the clock's
                                aesthetics but also ensures that it is lightweight and portable, making it easy to
                                transport.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Lithium Powered:</strong> The internal Lithium-Ion battery keeps the device wireless in use.
                                The design accommodates a USB-C charging port, with LED indications for the battery and charging states.
                                The large capacity of the battery ensures use for a lot of poker hours at a time!

                        <p><strong>Future Considerations:</strong> As the poker shot clock project continues to evolve,
                        future enhancements may include wireless connectivity for remote control and integration with
                        other gaming systems. Additional features such as programmable game presets and customizable
                        alarm sounds are also being considered to further enhance its utility and user experience.
