                        <strong>Description:</strong> This project entails the creation of a sophisticated poker shot
                        clock. The device is designed to manage the timing of player decisions during a poker game,
                        enhancing the pace of play and ensuring fair timing for all participants. The shot clock
                        features a clear display and intuitive controls, making it an easy-to-use tool for poker games.

                        <strong>Development Stage:</strong> Currently in its advanced prototype phase, the poker shot
                        clock employs a combination of custom-designed electronics and user-friendly software. The
                        device is powered by a STM32 microcontroller that ensures accurate timekeeping and responsive
                        operation. The clockâ€™s housing is 3D printed, providing durability and a sleek appearance.

                        <strong>Technical Highlights:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Precision Timing:</strong> The shot clock offers precise countdown and alarm
                                functionalities, with adjustable settings to accommodate different game formats and
                                player preferences.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Display and Controls:</strong> Featuring a bright LED display, the clock ensures
                                visibility from across the table. The user interface includes simple, clearly labeled
                                buttons for start, pause, and reset functions.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Custom Housing:</strong> The 3D printed casing not only enhances the clock's
                                aesthetics but also ensures that it is lightweight and portable, making it easy to
                                transport.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Lithium Powered:</strong> The internal Lithium-Ion battery keeps the device wireless in use.
                                The design accommodates a USB-C charging port, with LED indications for the battery and charging states.
                                The large capacity of the battery ensures use for a lot of poker hours at a time!
